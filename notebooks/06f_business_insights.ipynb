    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "based on our comprehensive analysis of county-level health needs, social vulnerability, and CVS clinic distribution, here are the key findings:\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coverage Gap**: 75% of U.S. counties have zero CVS MinuteClinic locations, creating significant access disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Socioeconomic Inequity**: Counties without clinics have higher socioeconomic vulnerability scores (0.504 vs 0.427), indicating that poorer communities are systematically underserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Health Need Mismatch**: Counties without clinics have higher health burden scores (16.37 vs 15.08), meaning the sickest populations have the least access to CVS services.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Geographic Patterns**: Underserved counties cluster in:\n",
    "   - Mississippi Delta region\n",
    "   - Rural South (Alabama, Georgia Black Belt)\n",
    "   - South Texas border region\n",
    "   - Native American communities in the Southwest\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Urban Opportunities**: Large metropolitan areas (Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Phoenix) show high population-adjusted gaps despite having some clinics, indicating unmet demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **K-Means Clustering** identified distinct county segments that can guide targeted expansion strategies, with high-priority clusters showing high health need, high population, and low clinic access.\n"

   "source": [
    "## Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priority 1: High-Impact Urban Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus**: Large metropolitan counties with high health burden and moderate-to-low clinic density\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Counties**: \n",
    "- Los Angeles County, CA\n",
    "- Harris County (Houston), TX\n",
    "- Dallas County, TX\n",
    "- Maricopa County (Phoenix), AZ\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**: Maximum population impact with existing infrastructure. These areas have millions of residents with unmet demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**what this means**: these are the counties where CVS can reach the most people with the greatest need. expanding here will have the biggest overall impact on community health access.\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Priority 2: Rural High-Need Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus**: Rural counties with high health burden scores and zero clinics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Regions**:\n",
    "- Mississippi Delta\n",
    "- Rural South (Alabama, Georgia Black Belt)\n",
    "- Native American communities in Southwest\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy**: Consider mobile clinics or partnerships with existing healthcare facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**what this means**: these areas have high health needs but small populations, making traditional clinic models less viable. innovative approaches like mobile clinics or partnerships can reach these underserved communities.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Priority 3: Vulnerable Community Access\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus**: Counties with high SVI scores and zero clinics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**: \n",
    "- Address socioeconomic barriers to healthcare access\n",
    "- Consider sliding scale pricing\n",
    "- Community health partnerships\n",
    "\n",
    "**what this means**: these communities face multiple challenges (poverty, limited transportation, etc.) that go beyond just needing a clinic. successful expansion here requires addressing these broader barriers to access.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Priority 4: Cluster-Based Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**: Use K-means clustering results to identify similar counties\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- Develop standardized expansion strategies for each cluster type\n",
    "- Leverage successful clinic models from similar county types\n",
    "- Efficient resource allocation based on county characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**what this means**: instead of treating all counties the same, we can develop tailored strategies for different types of counties. what works in one rural high-need county will likely work in similar counties in the same cluster.\n"

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Validate Findings\n",
    "cross-reference identified underserved counties with local healthcare infrastructure and competitor presence. understand what other healthcare options exist in these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Market Research\n",
    "conduct feasibility studies for top-priority expansion targets. assess local market conditions, regulatory requirements, and community needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Partnership Opportunities\n",
    "explore partnerships with local health systems in underserved areas. partnerships can help overcome barriers and share costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Pilot Programs\n",
    "launch pilot clinics in 2-3 high-priority counties to test expansion model. learn what works before scaling up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Monitor Impact\n",
    "track health outcomes and utilization rates in new clinic locations. measure success and adjust strategy based on results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Iterate Strategy\n",
    "use clustering results to refine expansion criteria and identify new opportunities. the analysis should be ongoing, not one-time.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "this analysis provides a data-driven foundation for CVS expansion strategy. by identifying underserved counties based on health need, population size, and current access, we can prioritize expansion efforts to maximize both business impact and community health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "the key insight is that there's a significant mismatch between where health needs are highest and where CVS clinics currently exist. addressing this gap represents both a business opportunity and a chance to improve health equity across the United States.\n"
